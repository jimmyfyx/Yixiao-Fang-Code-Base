# Yixiao's Coding Base
Currently, this repository contains all my work from all the coding-related courses at UIUC during my undergraduate study (2020 - 2024). Each folder corresponds to a course. 

I have also included the work I did during Summer 2022 as an indepedent study on Pytorch and deep learning, which is in the *pytorch* folder.
