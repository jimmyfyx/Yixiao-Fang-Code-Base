# CS498 Mobile Robotics in Computer Science (Fall 2022)
This course is about principles in mobile robotics, including basic kinematics, dynamics, control, and perception. For every module in this course, there is a corresponding problem set or coding exercise. <br/>

- All the coding exercises are completed by ROS2, so the related executable files are in the ROS2 workspace. <br/>
- There are also problem sets (also programming assignments), included in the 'Problem Sets' folder. <br/>
- For every coding exercise or problem set, there is a pdf file containing all the instructions. <br/>

More information please refer to the course website: http://daslab.illinois.edu/coursesfall2021.html

**11/9/2022 Update** add coding exercise 1 relevant files in the ROS2 workspace (course in progress)
