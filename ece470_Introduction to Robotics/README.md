# ECE470 Introduction to Robotics (Spring 2022)
This course includes basic concepts in robotics (particularly about robot arms), covering frame transformations, forward kinematics, inverse kinematics and so on. <br/>
Labs in this course require students to get familiar with using ROS to control the UR3 robot arm. The final project, which is lab5, allows students to develop an algorithm pick and place colored blocks with the assistance of camera.
