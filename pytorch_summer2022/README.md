# pytorch_summer2022
Currently, this folder contains my accomplishment during Summer 2022 while self-studying Pytorch from online sources and guidance from Ye-Ji Mun(yejimun2@illinois.edu), a graduate student of the Human-Centered Autonomy Lab at UIUC. 

Start from the basics Model, Linear Regression and Logistics Regression, to CNN, RNN, LSTM, and ConvLSTM. <br/>
For CNN, I used the CIFAR-10 and MNIST dataset to implement image classification. <br/>
I used the Moving-MNIST dataset to perform video prediction through ConvLSTM.
